Origin provides a simple and powerful javascript library for developers to build decentralized marketplaces, allowing buyers and sellers to meet and transact without requiring any trusted intermediaries.

### Usage

Visit our Github: [https://github.com/OriginProtocol](https://github.com/OriginProtocol)

This API documentation will explain how developers can use the origin.js library to create and manage decentralized marketplaces that are built on top of [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and the [Ethereum network](https://www.ethereum.org/).

Origin.js aims to create an easy and flexible abstraction layer that:

* Generates and deploys secure Ethereum smart contracts to the blockchain.
* Creates and posts user and listing metadata to distributed IPFS nodes
* Queries against open-source indexing servers to render content in decentralized applications (DApps)

Origin.js enables developers to create DApps that onboard new users to the Origin platform, add new listings to the listings registry, create booking contracts, close out bookings (transfer funds, write reviews, etc.), and more.

### Notes

Please note this project is still in heavy development and many of the features described below have not been implemented yet. This library should not be considered as production-ready.

Origin.js and the entire Origin Protocol project is 100% open-source and we welcome contributions from the community. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues and contributing code to helping us improve and grow our community.
