|commission | This is the total amount, spread across all `unitsTotal` units, the seller is willing to pay the DApp that sells the listing user after the sale is complete. The currency must be `OGN`. This money comes out of the deposit amount the seller puts into the listing.

This total commission amount should be enough to pay `commissionPerUnit` for each unit available. |
|commissionPerUnit | This is the amount the seller is willing to pay for each unit sold by the DApp that sells the listing user after the sale is complete. The currency must be `OGN`. This money comes out of the deposit amount the seller puts into the listing. Note that the deposit amount may very well be too low to actually pay the commission - this must be checked for before trusting the commission. |
