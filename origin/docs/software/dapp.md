This is an example DApp (Decentralized Application) that shows how easy it is to create a truly peer to peer marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain with Origin.js. 

You can **visit our [DApp on Mainnet](http://dapp.originprotocol.com/)** to see this in use, or check the [source on github](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-dapp).
