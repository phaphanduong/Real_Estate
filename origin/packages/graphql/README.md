# Origin GraphQL

This package provides a GraphQL interface to Origin Protocol
intended to be consumed by ApolloClient. It uses `apollo-link-schema` to
expose a client-side GraphQL server that can also be used server side.

This means a UI is able to leverage the power of GraphQL without depending on
a centralized server. The only server side dependencies are an Ethereum node and
and an IPFS server.

A GraphiQL demo is available [here](https://www.originadm.in/#/explorer)
