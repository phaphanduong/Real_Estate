  "title": "1977 International Scout II",
  "description": "Introduced in 1971, the International Scout II rode on a stretched-wheelbase version of the rugged Scout chassis as a competitor to trucks like the larger Chevrolet Blazer. The highly customizable Scout was popular for work and racing, taking home a class win in the 1977 Baja 1000. This restored beautifully restored 1977 Scout II's customizations run more than skin deep, with a 6.0-liter GM engine and transmission to go along with the wheels and suspension lift.",
